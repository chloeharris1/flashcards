# React Redux Flashcards

This project is part of Codecademy's Front-End Engineer Path.

## Description

In this project, I used Redux and Redux Toolkit to manage the complex state of a flashcard-style quiz app. Users are able to create their own topics, quizzes for those topics, and flashcards for those quizzes. Users will also be able to interact with their quizzes by flipping flashcards over.
